# full-stack-notes-app

## A full stack application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, or MERN

This application was created to demonstrate my abilities in using these four programs as well as other various third party libraries such as Marked and Redux Toolkit. The app is fully functional and features the following features:

- Fully functional login system using json web tokens and password hashing
- A complete markdown editor with live preview
- Fully responsive mobile layout that increases in complexity as the size of the window increases
- The ability to persist state after page reload by utilizing local storage

A live demo of the app can is hosted on [Heroku.](baker-notes.herokuapp.com)
